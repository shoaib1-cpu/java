### **Design Pattern Projects**
Create individual repositories or a single repository with subfolders for different design patterns. Document each pattern with examples and use cases.

---

#### **1. Creational Design Patterns**
- **Singleton Pattern**  
  Example: A configuration manager to ensure a single instance of configurations is used across the application.  
  Features:
  - Lazy initialization
  - Thread-safe implementation

- **Factory Method**  
  Example: A factory that creates different types of vehicles (e.g., `Car`, `Bike`).  
  Features:
  - Abstraction of object creation
  - Extensibility for new vehicle types

- **Abstract Factory**  
  Example: Cross-platform GUI application where factories produce `WindowsButton` and `MacButton`.  
  Features:
  - Family of related objects without specifying concrete classes

- **Builder Pattern**  
  Example: Constructing a complex `House` object with optional features like garden, pool, etc.  
  Features:
  - Step-by-step construction
  - Fluent interface

- **Prototype Pattern**  
  Example: Cloning objects such as documents or game characters.  
  Features:
  - Copy existing objects without modifying them

---

#### **2. Structural Design Patterns**
- **Adapter Pattern**  
  Example: Adapting a legacy system’s data format to a new API.  
  Features:
  - Interface compatibility

- **Decorator Pattern**  
  Example: Adding features to a `Coffee` object (e.g., Milk, Sugar) dynamically.  
  Features:
  - Extensibility without modifying existing code

- **Facade Pattern**  
  Example: Simplifying a complex subsystem like a media player with a `MediaPlayerFacade`.  
  Features:
  - Unified interface to a subsystem

- **Proxy Pattern**  
  Example: Implementing a virtual proxy for loading large images only when accessed.  
  Features:
  - Controlled access

- **Composite Pattern**  
  Example: Representing a folder structure where folders and files are treated uniformly.  
  Features:
  - Hierarchical structure representation

---

#### **3. Behavioral Design Patterns**
- **Observer Pattern**  
  Example: A notification system where multiple listeners get updates (e.g., email, SMS alerts).  
  Features:
  - Publish-subscribe mechanism

- **Strategy Pattern**  
  Example: A payment system supporting different strategies like `CreditCard`, `PayPal`.  
  Features:
  - Algorithm encapsulation

- **Command Pattern**  
  Example: Implementing an undo/redo functionality in a text editor.  
  Features:
  - Encapsulation of requests as objects

- **Chain of Responsibility**  
  Example: A support ticket system where requests pass through different levels (Level 1, Level 2).  
  Features:
  - Decoupling sender and receiver

- **State Pattern**  
  Example: Modeling a vending machine with states like `Idle`, `Dispensing`.  
  Features:
  - State-specific behavior

---

#### **4. Architectural Design Patterns**
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**  
  Example: A web application where the `Model` handles data, the `View` displays it, and the `Controller` manages input.  
  Features:
  - Separation of concerns

- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**  
  Example: A JavaFX application implementing MVVM for cleaner separation between UI and logic.  
  Features:
  - Two-way data binding

- **Publisher-Subscriber**  
  Example: An event-driven application where multiple components listen to a central event bus.  
  Features:
  - Decoupled communication

### **How to Showcase on GitHub**
1. **Repository Structure**:  
   ```
   DesignPatterns/
   ├── Creational/
   │   ├── Singleton/
   │   │   ├── Singleton.java
   │   │   └── README.md
   │   ├── FactoryMethod/
   │   └── ...
   ├── Structural/
   ├── Behavioral/
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **Documentation**:  
   - **README** for each pattern:
     - **Definition**
     - **Use Case**
     - **Implementation**
     - **Benefits and Trade-offs**
   - Add UML diagrams to illustrate relationships.

3. **Code Quality**:  
   - Follow clean code principles.
   - Include JUnit tests for pattern validation.

4. **Demo Applications**:  
   - Build small demo projects implementing multiple patterns together (e.g., an e-commerce app using Factory, Singleton, and Observer).

5. **Interactive Features**:  
   - Include a Java console app for pattern demonstrations.
